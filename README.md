# -Emotion-analysis
# In the era of booming e-commerce, customers frequently leave millions of reviews and comments after purchasing products. These reviews carry valuable insights for businesses to understand customer satisfaction and preferences.

# This project aims to build a sentiment analysis system based on customer reviews collected from popular e-commerce platforms such as Shopee, Lazada, and Tiki. The system applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with machine learning and deep learning models such as BERT, RoBERTa, or traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.

# The goal is to classify customer sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The project evaluates the performance of different models and selects the most effective one for practical application.
